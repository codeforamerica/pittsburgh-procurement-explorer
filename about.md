This is a click-through explorer of the different procurement processes available to civil servants in the City of Pittsburgh. Starting with a question of whether or not your item is on contract, you click through until you figure out which process you are supposed to use for filing a bid.

A tree visualization of these processes is also in development, and a link will be made available here when it is finished.
