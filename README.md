# Pittsburgh Procurement Explorer

The Pittsburgh procurement explorer tool is an exploratory application built by [Team Pittsburgh](www.codeforamerica.org/governments/pittsburgh/) with help from the [Department of Innovation and Procurement](http://pittsburghpa.gov/innovation-performance/home) and the [Office of Management and Budget](pittsburghpa.gov/omb) to allow people to click through simple questions and arrive at a final page that shows which type of purchasing process to pursue.

### Installation and Development

pittsburgh-procurement-explorer is a Jekyll site. For information on getting started with Jekyll, please refer to the [howto](https://github.com/codeforamerica/howto/blob/master/Jekyll.md).

### Deployment

The tool is hosted on github pages, so deploying is as simple as pushing updates to the `gh-pages` branch. Because standard HTML sites are valid Jekyll, [deploying the built site directly](http://www.aymerick.com/2014/07/22/jekyll-github-pages-bower-bootstrap.html) is encouraged.

### Future Plans

[ ] Create a tree visualization of the process
[ ] Add some copy to the terminating nodes about what each process type is or means
[ ] Add links to other resources (about county/state process, contract lists, etc.)
