Sole source agreements are unique professional service agreements which may include subscriptions, sometimes include maintenance/warranty work on equipment.

According to a 2009 City of Pittsburgh policy document,

> a **Sole Source Professional Services contract** is a contract involving unique professional services that are documented to be available from one source only. An example could be art restoration by a particular artist on his or her own work. The term may also include specialized training or maintenance services on verified sole-source purchases.

More information about sole source contracts is coming soon.
