#### What's the difference between professional services and goods/services?

Good question! The following definition of professional services is excerpted from a City of Pittsburgh 2009 policy memo about such services:

> **Professional Services contract** - a contract involving services of members of the medical or legal profession, registered architects, appraisers, auditors, engineers, certified public accountants or other personal services that involve quality as the paramount concern and require a recognized professional and special expertise.
